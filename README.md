## 3.1. Current Version

The current version of the CAPIv2 is `v2.0.22` and is still in active development and testing. If you would like to contribute please PM DMehaffy on discord `DMehaffy#1337`

# 4. API Documentation

Our Swagger docs are auto-generated by our API, each environment (Production, Staging, Development) have their own docs based on the release version.

[Development](https://api.canonn.tech:2083/documentation)
[Staging](https://api.canonn.tech:2053/documentation)
[Production](https://api.canonn.tech/documentation)

# 5. Prerequisites

You will need the following:
- Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
  - **Ubuntu 16.04 is no longer supported**
- Git
- Node v10 or above
- NPM v6 or above
- Node PM2 (For running API as a service)
- Strapi Alpha Latest
- MariaDB 10.2 or above

## 5.1. Installing Git, Node v10, and NPM v6

First add the NodeJS Apt repos:

`
curl -sL https://deb.nodesource.com/setup_10.x | sudo -E bash -
`

Then install Git, Node, and NPM:

`
sudo apt-get install -y nodejs git build-essential
`

## 5.2. Install PM2 to run as a service

Run the following to install PM2 globally on your system:

`
sudo npm install pm2 -g
`

## 5.3. Install Strapi Alpha Latest

Run the following to install Strapi Alpha:

`
sudo npm i strapi@alpha -g
`

This will install strapi globally and allow you to generate new projects or models/api/ect from the cli

See the following for a more detailed guide: https://strapi.io/documentation/cli/CLI.html

## 5.4. Setup MariaDB

Install Software Properties Common if its not already installed:

`
sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
`

Then add the MariaDB Apt repos:

```
sudo apt-key adv --recv-keys --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 0xF1656F24C74CD1D8

sudo add-apt-repository 'deb [arch=amd64,i386,ppc64el] http://nyc2.mirrors.digitalocean.com/mariadb/repo/10.2/ubuntu xenial main'
```

Update your apt cache and install the server and client:

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y mariadb-server-10.2 mariadb-client-10.2
```

**Note that as of MariaDB 10.2 it no longer asks for the root password**

To change the MariaDB root password you will need to su to the local root account, enter a mysql shell, and change it:

```
sudo -i
*asks for password*

mysql -u root -p
```

```
USE mysql;
UPDATE user SET password=PASSWORD('YourPasswordHere') WHERE User='root' AND Host = 'localhost';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
exit;
exit
```

# 6. Create Database & User for Strapi

Now we need to create the database that will hold the Strapi data, first enter a mysql shell as root:

`
mysql -u root -p
`

Then create the database and user:

```
create database capiv2;
create user 'capiv2system'@'localhost' identified by 'YourPasswordHere';
grant all privileges on capiv2.* to 'capiv2system'@'localhost';
```

After this you should have the following database `capiv2` with the user `capiv2system` and a password for use with Strapi.

# 7. Clone the CAPIv2-Strapi project and Setup

Now that we have the database we can clone the API and install it, we will use `/srv/CAPI/CAPIv2` but you can install it anywhere.

## 7.1. Clone the API

Lets create our project directory and clone the CAPIv2 Build

`
sudo mkdir /srv/CAPI && sudo chown YourUserName:YourUserGroup /srv/CAPI
`

`
cd /srv/CAPI && git clone https://github.com/canonn-science/CAPIv2-Strapi.git CAPIv2
`

**NOTE** Currently you will need to make the uploads directory for screenshots, to do so please run:

`
mkdir /srv/CAPI/CAPIv2/public/uploads
`

## 7.2. Enter the directory and install

`
cd /srv/CAPI/CAPIv2 && npm install
`

**Note this may take a while**

## 7.3. Setup python3 for scripts

~~CAPIv2 uses a few python scripts to update data from EDSM to our database. The database information is pulled from the database.json file you will configure in the next step.~~

We no longer use python scripts as all of our updates are done via our external program the [CAPIv2-Updater](https://github.com/canonn-science/CAPIv2-Updater)

## 7.4. Create the Dev database.json

In order for strapi to talk to the MariaDB database we setup you will need to copy and modify the following file:

`cp /srv/CAPI/CAPIv2/config/environments/development/database.json.example /srv/CAPI/CAPIv2/config/environments/development/database.json
`

The example config is also down below, you will just need to modify the Database, User, and password you setup:

```json
{
  "defaultConnection": "default",
  "connections": {
    "default": {
      "connector": "strapi-hook-bookshelf",
      "settings": {
        "client": "mysql",
        "host": "127.0.0.1",
        "port": 3306,
        "database": "exampledatabase",
        "username": "exampleuser",
        "password": "examplepassword"
      },
      "options": {
        "ssl": false,
        "acquireConnectionTimeout": 100000
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Optionally you can add database debug to make sure everything starts up smooth:

```json
      },
      "options": {
        "ssl": false,
        "debug": true,
        "acquireConnectionTimeout": 100000
      }
```

## 7.5. Start CAPIv2 for the first time

Once it has finished setting up, you can start it once in order to create your admin user:

```
cd /srv/CAPI/CAPIv2 && strapi start
```

**Note this may take a while, if you hit any issues with bookshelf taking to long, increase the hook time in the file below:**

`nano /srv/CAPI/CAPIv2/config/hook.json`

```
{
  "timeout": 60000, #Increase this Number and do not include this comment
  "load": {
    "before": [],
    "order": [
      "Define the hooks' load order by putting their names in this array in the right order"
    ],
    "after": []
  }
}
```

## 7.6. Create the Admin User

After strapi has started you can visit `http://localhost:1337` if you are on the machine, else you can change `localhost` to your servers IP. **Note that doing this on the current version will take you to our docs page located in the /public folder**

Currently there is no public frontend, we will however replace this in the future before public release. To create your user go to `http://localhost:1337/admin`

## 7.7. Running CAPIv2 as a service

To run strapi as a service, a change was made in the package.json, and you have installed Pm2 in a previous step. You will need to navigate to the directory the API is cloned into and run the following:

`
NODE_ENV=development pm2 start strapi --no-pmx --name="capiv2" -- start
`

Alternatively you can modify the `NODE_ENV` for staging or production use

Note you will need to also create the `database.json` located in `config/enviroments/staging` or `config/enviroments/production`

# 8. Seed files for testing

Seed files will be stored in CSV format in the directory `seed_files`

We will also include a .sql export of the development database which will include all of the .csv exports including a single admin user called `canonntest` using the password `canonntest`. Permissions have been modified to allow count, find, and findone on all endpoints. As well as adding create and update on the report endpoints.
