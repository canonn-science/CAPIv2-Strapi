## Information

  description: |
    An API for all the Science related information Canonn has in its datastores stored on the Gnosis, built using [Strapi](https://strapi.io) a Nodejs API framework.

    # Documentation
    We have two different documentation types

    * [Redocs](./)
    * [Swagger-UI](./swaggerui)

    You can view our Swagger/OpenAPI on [CAPIv2-Swagger Github](https://github.com/canonn-science/CAPIv2-Swagger) and our API development [CAPIv2-Strapi Github](https://github.com/canonn-science/CAPIv2-Strapi).

    We also automatically build our current Development branch before deploying to the Alpha server, you can see our [Travis-CI](https://travis-ci.org/canonn-science/CAPIv2-Strapi) build status.

    # Servers

    We also have 3 API servers; Live (Production), Beta (Staging), Alpha (Development). You should use the Beta server for testing your application prior to using the Live server. The Alpha server is used by Canonn to test our changes prior to releasing a new version.

    Data between the Live and Beta servers are replicated as needed, eventually we plan to dynamically replicate the data every night at midnight Phoenix, Arizona USA time (MST-Arizona GMT-7)

    Server Name  | Server Type | Server URL | Server version
    ---------|---------|---------|---------
    Live | Production | https://api.canonn.tech | v2.0.7
    Beta | Production | https://api.canonn.tech:2053 | v2.0.7
    Alpha | Production | https://api.canonn.tech:2083 | v2.0.8

    Thank you for your support, and thank you to all the CMDRs who supply us with our data!
